# ITA_Repository
My final submit in the ITA course
This project is a book management system, where users can log in, access a list of books, view details such as title, author and synopsis, and interact with the system to earn points and trophies as rewards. The system includes a simple interface, presenting options such as viewing the user's profile and a ranking based on accumulated points. The idea is to gamify the reading experience, making interaction with books more engaging and rewarding.
